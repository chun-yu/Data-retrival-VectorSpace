# Data-retrival-VectorSpace

Use the vector space method to rank the priority order of each document for each query.

Find out the Query in Query_Document.rar.
Every Query has some string IDs for checking.
Each document has many character IDs to form a long article.

Use limited query characters to make vector space with document characters to calculate the relationship distance between the two.
